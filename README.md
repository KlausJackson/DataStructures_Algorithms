My Python, C++ code and notes while learning about Data Structures and Algorithms. <br>

## Credits
Most of my code are from the following source on Udemy:
- [Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises](https://ascend.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python)
- [C++ Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises](https://ascend.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-cpp)

The instructor: [Scott Barrett](https://ascend.udemy.com/user/scott-barrett-16/) <br>
The rest of my code are solutions to some problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). <br>

## Data Structures
* Singly linked list (25 LEETCODE problems, starts from line 90) <br>
    - Dynamic memory aloocation. <br>
    - Efficeint insertion and deletion at the begining. <br>
* Doubly linked list <br>
    - Bi-directional traversal. <br>
    - Efficient deletion of a node. <br>
* Stack <br>
    - Function call management. <br>
    - Undo/redo operations. <br>
* Queues <br>
    - Job scheduling. <br>
    - Breadth-first search (BFS). <br>


## Algorithms
* Backtracking : recursively exploring all possible solutions until a valid solution is found. <br>

## Note
I added comments in the code, they're explainations based on my understanding. <br>
