# DataStructures_Algorithms
My code while learning about Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Credits

Most of my code are from the [Python Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises](https://ascend.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/) course on Udemy. <br>
The instructor: [Scott Barrett](https://ascend.udemy.com/user/scott-barrett-16/) <br>
The rest of my code are solutions to some problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). <br>

## List

Singly linked list (25 LEETCODE problems, starts from line 90) <br>
Doubly linked list <br>
Stack <br>




## Note

I added comments in the code, they're explainations based on my understanding. <br>
