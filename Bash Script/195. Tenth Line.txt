Given a text file file.txt, print just the 10th line of the file.

**Example:**
Assume that file.txt has the following content:
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10

Your script should output the tenth line, which is:
Line 10

**Answer:**
sed -n '10p' file.txt

**Explanation:**
sed is a stream editor that can perform various operations on text files.

-n suppresses the default output, so it only prints the lines we specify.

'10p' tells sed to print the 10th line of the file.
