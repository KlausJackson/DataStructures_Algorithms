Write a bash script to calculate the
frequency
of each word in a text file words.txt.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.
Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.

**Example:**
Assume that words.txt has the following content:
the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is

Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:
the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1

**Answer:** 
cat words.txt | tr -s ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2, $1}'

**Explanation:**

cat words.txt : Reads the contents of the words.txt file.

tr -s ' ' '\n' : Replaces all consecutive spaces with a single newline character, effectively splitting the input into individual words.

sort : Sorts the words in alphabetical order.

uniq -c : Counts the number of occurrences of each unique word.

sort -nr : Sorts the output by the count (second column) in descending numerical order.

awk '{print $2, $1}' : Prints the word (second column) and its frequency (first column) in the desired format.
